Using engeld/dotfiles
======================

## Install ##
On a new computer, simply *clone* the repository.

Add a new dotfile to the repository: `mv ~/.dotfile ~/dotfiles/dotfile`  
Link the dotfile from the repo to the homedir: `ln -s ~/dotfiles/dotfile ~/.dotfile`

## Pitfalls's (AKA 'Things that may or may not work)  ##
* if the repository-folder is moved, the symlinks may not work anymore?
