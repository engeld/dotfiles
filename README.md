How to deploy the dotfiles?
---------------------------
Just run the following script, which can be found in the same git-repo as this README:
''''Shell
./deploy_dotfiles
''''

The script does the following:
* Checks if the dotfiles are already in place
  * If so, abort and print error message (TODO: compare them and suggest a merge - but first decide how to compare them)
  * OR, if the script is running with an "-f" parameter, then rename the already existing files with an suffix called ".old"
* Then simlink the dotfiles to their normal place
